# Titanic Dataset — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains a complete, step-by-step **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the [Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) dataset.  
The analysis was conducted in Python using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** within Google Colab.
